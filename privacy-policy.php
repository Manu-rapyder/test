				<p>Within our organization, your personal data is accessible to only a limited number of employees with special access privileges.

				<h4><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> Information Sharing</h4>
				<p>This is probably the most important question in your mind as to with whom do we share your information? The answer to this question is that we do not rent, sell, barter, or give away your information to anyone. To some extent, information has to be passed on to the courier companies, credit card processing companies, vendors, etc. to enable them to perform their functions related to your order fulfilment. Apart from this normal business requirement, information may also be needed to be shared with law authorities, for fraud detection, and for the safety of our site, employees, management, users, members and other affiliates associated with us</p>

				<h4><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> Information Usage</h4>
				<p>The most important usage of the information collected from you is your email which is used to inform you that your order has been confirmed/executed. Your email is also used to inform you for your customer service related queries and for any newsletters sent. All other information collected is confidentially stored and will not be disclosed unless needed as per the requirement of the law authorities or in case of any disputes.</p>
